              <p>The first duty of any Government is to safeguard its people against external aggression. To guarantee the survival of our way of life.
                The question we must now ask ourselves is whether the present Government is fulfilling that duty. It is dismantling our defences at a moment when the strategic threat to Britain and her allies from an expansionist power is graver than at any moment since the end of the last war.
                Military men are always warning us that the strategic balance is tilting against NATO and the west.
                But the Socialists never listen.

                Perhaps some people in the Labour Party think we are on the same side as the Russians!

              <p>A huge, largely land-locked country like Russia does not need to build the most powerful navy in the world just to guard its own frontiers.
                No. The Russians are bent on world dominance, and they are rapidly acquiring the means to become the most powerful imperial nation the world has seen.
                The men in the Soviet politburo don't have to worry about the ebb and flow of public opinion. They put guns before butter, while we put just about everything before guns.
                They know that they are a super power in only one senseâ€”the military sense.

                At Helsinki we endorsed the status quo in Eastern Europe. In return we had hoped for the freer movement of people and ideas across the Iron Curtain. So far we have got nothing of substance.
                We are devoted, as we always have been, to the maintenance of peace. 
                We will welcome any initiative from the Soviet Union that would contribute to that goal.

              <p>A man who has spent the past two years in a care home separated from his dog has been reunited with his beloved companion after moving to a new home.

              <p>Lawrence Knight, 73, was admitted to a home in Manchester in 2019 after being diagnosed with dementia.

              <p>But dogs were not allowed and his golden labrador, Millie, had to be put into a shelter.</p>
              <p>But after hearings with the Court of Protection the pair have moved into a lakeside care home together
